## Next up: Where do good ideas come from?
<hr>

**Watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb0ssmoXG1I&app=desktop by Steven Johnson**

**Johnsons uses the concept of the adjacent possible to explore the origin of good ideas**

- **For discussion:** Listen to the video and jot down (without thinking too much) what this concept sparks in you. Then:
    + do you think the idea of adjacent possible applies to humans under pressures from global change?
    + do you think the idea of adjacent possible applies to future human decision making with global change?
    + Practive writing your answers as clearly as possible (K.I.S.S)
    + Submit on Brightspace (Thursday midnight) and be ready to discuss
