## How does phenotypic plasticity happen?
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

* **Instantaneous / instinctual responses**

<br/>

* **Gene expression responses**
    + DNA -> RNA

<br/>

* **Epigenetic responses**
    + whet
    + study of how your behaviors and environment can cause changes that affect the way your genes work

## Changes to DNA sequence underlie plasticity
<hr>
<br/>

**Traditionally it was thought that changes to the sequence of DNA were heritable while changes to the expression patterns of DNA were not**

<br/>

**That made it easy to define adaptation as “heritable genetic change” and plasticity as “non-genetic”**

<br/>

**But those lines are becoming blurred as we learn about mechanisms (like histone modification) that can make gene expression changes heritable**

## The adjust response
<hr>
<br/>

**Adjust: non-genetic shifts in organismal traits in different environments (phenotypic plasticity)**

<br/>

**The adjust response happens at the level of the individual and happens within a single generation**

<br/>

**The adapt response happens at the level of the population and happens across generations**

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

**Village communities used the region before the establishment of Limpopo National Park **

<br/>

**After the park’s establishment, village communities live within the park buffer zone**

<br/>

**The buffer zone is an important area for wildlife **

**Strategies Dealing with Drought before the National Park**

<br/>
<br/>

* **Small plots in multiple areas**
<br/>
* **Sharing plots**
<br/>
* **Seeding at every rainfall**
<br/>
* **Temporary migration**
<br/>
* **Crop mixing**

**Strategies Dealing with Drought before the National Park**

<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 55%;">

**WILDLIFE: As drought intensifies, elephants compensate by increasing usage of areas nearest the river, including crop fields**

<br/>

**HUMAN: Village communities respond by using fencing and altering cropping practices **

## Meet the Data: Shifts with global warming
<hr>
<br/>

**What shifts (in space and time) do we see most commonly for organisms with global warming?**

<br/>
<br/>

* **Geographic shifts toward the poles**
<br/>

* **Geographic shifts up in elevation**
<br/>

* **Seasonal shifts earlier in the year**

## Phenotypic plasticity in development
<hr>
**Example from insects: As ecotherms, temperature matters a lot for insect survival, development, dispersal, etc.**
<br/>
**Insect life histories are very tied to environmental factors **


<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:240px; LEFT:50px; WIDTH:1000px; HEIGHT:400px" SRC="images/locusts.png">

## Phenotypic plasticity in development
<hr>

* **For example, a major effect of global warming on insects is to speed up developmental rates**
    + can lead to faster maturity

<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 55%;">
**In the UK >70% of butterfly species studies have earlier “first flight”**

<br/>

**First flight is predicted to occur 2-10 days earlier for every 1°C**
</div>

## Phenotypic plasticity in development
<hr>

* **For example, a major effect of global warming on insects is to speed up developmental rates**
    + can lead to more generations per year

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<div style="float: left; width: 55%;">
**increase of temperatures by 2°C is predicted to allow some aphid species to produce an additional 4–5generations per year.**

## Phenotypic plasticity in development
<hr>
<br/>

**Temperature-induced advancement in development is common and relates to a broader pattern…**

<br/>

**Phenological changes: changes in periodic biological phenomena (like flowering, breeding, migration, etc.)**

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:280px; LEFT:150px; WIDTH:800px; HEIGHT:350px" SRC="images/phenology.png">

## Phenotypic plasticity in development
<hr>
<br/>

**2003 meta-analyses found an advancement of an average of 2.3 days per decade**
<br/>
**Remarkably consistent across groups (and that was 20 years ago!!!)**

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:280px; LEFT:150px; WIDTH:800px; HEIGHT:350px" SRC="images/phenology2.png">

## Phenotypic plasticity in development
<hr>

**With global warming we expect many temperature dependent processes to occur earlier in the year**
    + Even a few days matters…**
    + Phenological mismatch: When interacting species are no longer temporally or spatially aligned (we will return to this in Chap 9)**

## Friday Discussion: Can Humans Adjust to Global Change?
<hr>
<br/>

* **Journal Club message: Humans have high adatptive capacity..**
    + what about short term change?

<br/>

* **What evidence exists? Past, present and/or future**
    + can we acclimate to .....
    + what traits are plastic (or not)

<br/>

* **Be prepared to discuss what you found as well as your opinion on if it is possible**

<br/>

* **Submit an article/finding on Brightspace for participation**
