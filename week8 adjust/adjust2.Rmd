## How does phenotypic plasticity happen?
<hr>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

* **Instantaneous / instinctual responses**
    + behavior or physiology
    
<br/>

* **Gene expression responses**
    + DNA -> RNA
    + increase or decrease production of RNA/proteins

<br/>

* **Epigenetic responses**
    + mechanisms where DNA is not accessible for transcription
    + DNA still does not change
    + possibly inherited

**Vinclozolin is a fungicide used by farmers to stop rot, mold and blight**

<br/>

**Vinclozolin linked to great granddaughter's stress via DNA methylation**

**DDT, the first modern pesticide, has been banned in USA since 1972**

<br/>

**Pregnant female mice fed DDT and their female offspring had a lower tolerance for cold temperature and were more obsese**

## Changes to gene expression underlie plasticity
<hr>

**Traditionally, it was thought that changes to the sequence of DNA were heritable while changes to the expression patterns of DNA were not**

<br/>

**That made it easy to define adaptation as “heritable genetic change” and plasticity as “non-genetic”**
<br/>

**<span style="color:red">Epigenetics blurs those lines</span>**

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:360px; LEFT:200px; WIDTH:600px; HEIGHT:300px" SRC="images/epigenetics2.jpg">

## The adjust response
<hr>

**<span style="color:blue">Adjust</span>: non-genetic shifts in organismal traits in different environments (phenotypic plasticity)**

<br/>

**The <span style="color:blue">adjust</span> response happens at the level of the individual and happens within a single generation (MOSTLY)**

<br/>

**The <span style="color:green">adapt</span> response (Chapter 7) happens at the level of the population and happens across generations**

<br/>

* **Can plasticity and adaption be connected?**
    + can plasticity buy time: YES
    + can plasticity promote adaptive genetic change:?
        + phenotype produced with enhanced survival...
        + loss of plasticity after environmental change...
        + selection of more or less plasticity...

## Meet the Data: Shifts with global warming
<hr>
<br/>

**What shifts (in space and time) do we see most commonly for organisms with global warming?**

<br/>
<br/>

* **Geographic shifts toward the poles**

<br/>

* **Geographic shifts up in elevation**

<br/>

* **Geographic shifts deeper in oceans**

<br/>

* **<span style="color:blue">Seasonal shifts earlier in the year</span>**

    + can lead to faster maturity

**In the UK >70% of butterfly species studies have earlier “first flight”**

**Increase of temperatures by 2°C is predicted to allow some aphid species to produce an additional 4–5 generations per year.**

## Phenotypic plasticity in development
<hr>
<br/>

**Temperature-induced advancement in development is common and relates to a broader pattern…**

<br/>

**Phenological changes: changes in periodic biological phenomena (like flowering, breeding, migration)**

## Phenotypic plasticity in development

**2003 meta-analyses found an advancement of an average of 2.3 days per decade**
<br/>

**Remarkably consistent across groups (and that was 20 years ago!!!)**

## Phenotypic plasticity in development

<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 55%;">

* **With global warming we expect many temperature dependent processes to occur earlier in the year**
    + Even a few days matters

<br/>

<span style="color:darkgreen">**Phenological mismatch: When interacting species are no longer temporally or spatially aligned</span> (Chapter 9)**

<br/>

* **Biodiversity loss is linked with Phenological mismatches**
    + no organisms is infinitely plastic
    + mismatches impact many species in food webs

## Friday Discussion: Can Humans *Adjust* to Global Change?
<hr>
<br/>

* **Previous journal club message: Humans have high adaptive capacity..**
    + what about short-term change?

<br/>

* **What evidence exists? Past, present and/or future**
    + can we acclimate to .....
    + what traits are plastic (or not)
    + human behaviorial shifts...

<br/>

* **Be prepared to discuss what you found as well as your opinion on if it is possible**

<br/>

* **Submit an article/finding on Brightspace for participation**
