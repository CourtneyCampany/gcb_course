## The Adjacent Possible
<hr>

**Confronted with a changing world, organisms can move, adjust, adapt, or die**

<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 55%;">

**In physical space -> <span style="color:blue">move</span>**

<br/>

**In physiological / behavioral space -> <span style="color:blue">adjust</span>**

<br/>

**In genetic / adaptive space -> <span style="color:blue">adapt</span>**

<br/>

**If no adjacent possible -> <span style="color:blue">die</span>**

<br/>

**<span style="color:darkred">Responses are not mutually exclusive</span>**
</div>

* **What are the adjacent possible options for survival?**

<br/>

* **What determines the adjacent possible?**
    + Organismal traits
    + Environmental features
    + Dynamics of change

<br/>

* **Can a trait adjust?**

## Organismal responses to change: Adjust
<hr>

* **Adjust: non-genetic shifts in organismal traits in different environments**
    + *phenotypic plasticity*, acclimation, acclimitization

<br/>

* **Adjust response happens at the *individual* level and within a *single* generation**
    + What does this mean?

**Genotype: inherited genetic information **

<br/>

**Phenotype: observable traits or characteristics**

<br/>
<br/>

**What is the connection between genotype & phenotype?**

<br/>

**Genotype x Environment = Phenotype variation?**

<br/>

**G x E interactions are the foundation of phenotypic plasticity**

## What is phenotypic plasticity?
<hr>
<br/>

**When a single genotype can produce multiple phenotypes depending on environmental conditions**

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

* **Inducible defenses are classic example**
    + animals and plants
    + often fast
    + stabilize population dynamics
    + dedicated sensory systems to interpret the environment

<br/>

**Daphnia produce horns and neck teeth in presence of predators**

## Density-induced grasshopper plasticity
<hr>
**Plasticity can occur as a specturm of changes in a trait (not just off or on)**
<br/>

**Grasshopper camoflauge and behavior is influenced by 'crowdedness'**

**When a single genotype can produce multiple phenotypes depending on environmental conditions**

<div style="float: left; width: 55%;">


<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

* **Plasticity doesn’t have to be for morphological traits.**

<br/>

* **Physiological, developmental and behavioral traits can also exhibit plasticity**

<br/>

* **Behavior has long been considered the 'most plastic' phenotypic trait** 
    + quickest response to temporal changes 
    + e.g., bird song frequency in urban environments

## What is phenotypic plasticity?
<hr>
<br/>
**When a single genotype can produce multiple phenotypes depending on environmental conditions**

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

* **Developmental plasticity: the ability of an individual to modify its development in response to environmental conditions**
    + might facilitate the evolution of novel traits

<br/>

* **How developmental flexibility promotes innovations that persist over evolutionary time is unclear**

<br/>

* **However, exposure to environmental variation is a characteristic feature of normal development**
    + do certain genotypes have the ability to produce different development outcomes?

## Are all traits plastic? 
<hr>
<br/>

* **Optimal responses to environmental challenges would include perfect plasticity**
    + organism possesses perfect information on its current environment
    + mechanisms to produce an appropriate phenotypic response at all points in development

<br/>

* **Instead, traits exist on a spectrum that are determined exclusively by genetics and those influenced mostly by the environment**
    + no organism is entirely or infinitely plastic
    + what is the cost to evolving plasticity?
    
<br/>

* **Interesting point: Organisms in heterogeneous (variable) environments are more likely to have selection of traits that can be plastic**
    + low genetic diversity can limit selection of plastic traits
    
## How do you test for phenotypic plasticity?
<hr>
<br/>
**How do you figure out if a trait is controlled by genes, the environment or both?**
