- **Over human history...**
    + **Biomass of terrestrial vegetation has halved**

## What else is wrong with this representation?
<hr>
<br/>

**In addition to other harmful fallacies this cartoon propagates, it makes “being human” seem very simple, very separate, and very independent**

## Is independence just another human fallacy?

## What does it mean to be *Homo sapiens*?
<hr>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 45%;">

- **<span style="color:blue">Example 1: your inner ecosystem</span>**
    + >10,000 species occupy human body
    + 80-100 genera

<br/>

- **39 trillion microbial cells including bacteria, viruses and fungi live on-in us**
    + 'cell-wise' the human body is 43% human
    
<br/>

- **Human microbiome has 500x more genes than human**

<div style="float: right; width: 55%;">

- **<span style="color:blue">Example 2: (barely) hidden in your DNA</span>**

<br/>

- **~8% human genome is viral remnants**

<br/>

- **~40% human genome is repetitive DNA which also likely has a viral origin**

<br/>

- **100,000 pieces of ancient viral DNA live among our genes**
    + function, if any, has long been unclear

<div style="float: right; width: 65%;">

- **<span style="color:blue">Example 2: (barely) hidden in your DNA</span>**

<br/>

- **Most humans have 2% Neanderthal DNA**
    + remember - both species co-existed and sometimes mated 

<br/>

- **Neanderthal allele variants range in diverse expression of skin and hair color to immune function and neuropsychiatric disease**
    + may have left us prone to allergies!
    + may have caused some to have higher risks from Covid!
    + possible genetic links to depression and addiction

## Review: We are not 'independent' because we persisted

## *H.sapiens* overlapped with 2 others for 1,000s of years

## H. neanderthalensis are our closest extinct relative
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

- **Modern molecular tools have been able to sequence Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes**

<br/>


- **Denisovans left genetic traces in oceanic and Asian regions**
    + genomes of Australian aborigines, New Guineans and Pacific Islanders ~6% Denisovan

<br/>

- **How separate or independent our we?**
    + perhaps.....just enough.....

## Meet the Data: Has proportion of shared ancestry changed?
<hr>
**Fu et al. (2016) The genetic history of Ice Age Europe. Nature 534: 7606-7616**

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:200px; LEFT:200px; WIDTH:700px; HEIGHT:450px" SRC="images/iceage.png">

## Key questions from Fu et al. 2016
<hr>
<br/>


**<span style="color:blue">Is there a particular part of the world where you would predict Neanderthal ancestry in modern human genomes would be particularly high? Why?</span>**

<br/>

**<span style="color:blue">Do you expect the proportion of Neanderthal ancestry to increase, decrease, or stay constant over the last 50,000 years? Why?</span>**

<br/>

- **Data: genomes of 51 modern humans over a time series of Europe migration**
    + 45,000 - 7,000 years ago
    + taken from archaeological sites

<br/>

- **Compared SNP's = sites in genome with known variation among individuals**
    + up to 1000 nucleotides of DNA is a SNP

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:700px; LEFT:250px; WIDTH:450px; HEIGHT:450px" SRC="images/snp.jpg">

## What do the data show?
<hr>

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:160px; LEFT:50px; WIDTH:1000px; HEIGHT:500px" SRC="images/fuetal.png">

## Why would ancestral Neanderthal DNA be decreasing?
<hr>

**Natural selection against Neanderthal DNA is likely responsible for the change, but some will likely persist**

## Why did humans win the survival race?
<hr>
<div style="float: left; width: 55%;">
- **Was it key 'human' traits?**
    + many of these were shared (bi-pedalism, tools)

<br/>

- **Was it evolution of larger brains?**
    + our we that different than Neanderthals?

<br/>

- **Was it fire?**
    + H.erectus may have used fire before we evolved

<br/>

- **Was is related to social aspects**
    + survival of the friendliest

<br/>

- **Was it related to our adaptability**?
    + climate was unpredictable
    
<br/>

- **Was it something non-human?**
    + superior microbiome

 </div>
 
<div style="float: right; width: 45%;">
 
- **Was it luck?**
    + were we 'independent' enough?

## Next up: Friday open-discussion of human impacts
<hr>

- **Humans have existed for ~300,000 years**

<br/>

- **For how long and in how many ways have *H.sapiens* altered Earth's systems and landscapes?**

<br/>

- **Find as many examples as you can**
    + Be creative in your search (scholarly or not)
    + think beyond Industrial Revolution and CO~2~

<br/>

- **We will create a timeline of influence on the board**
    + each of you will add something

<br/>    

- **We will then discuss what it all means**
    + Submit your evidence (link or aritcle) on Brightspace
