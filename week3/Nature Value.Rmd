- **Scientific Value**: 
<!-- Factors that lead to gain or loss of species -->

<br/>

- **Value to Human Health**: 
<!-- We rely on natural systems -->

<br/>

- **Economic Value**: 
<!-- Biodiversity has infinite commercial value -->

<br/>

- **Cultural Value**: 
<!-- Natural world anchors human culture -->

- *Ecosystem services* = varied benefits to humans provided by the natural environment from healthy ecosystems

<br/>

- Healthy ecosystems provide benefits for all life on earth, but valuing them for what the provide humans is a key management and policy tool (*especially for global change*)
    + which ones are the most vulnerable?
    + which ones are the most essential to humans?
    + globally? regionally? locally? culturally?

## Next up: Friday open-discussion on the 'value of nature'
<hr>
<br/>

- **Which value resonates most with you personally? **

<br/>

- **Make a persuasive argument for which value aspect of biodiversity is the most important?**

<br/>

- **Prepare a 'legal brief' to present to a small group**
    + summarize your argument into a few key points
    + provide real tangible evidence
    + submit your brief on Brightspace (can be rough)
    
<br/>
 
- **Feel free to argue the path less traveled**

<br/>

- **Your small group will need to come to a decision based on everyone's briefs**
